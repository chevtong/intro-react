Title: Your first front-end framework: React
Repository: intro-react
Mode: solo
Type of Challenge: learning
Duration: week-ish
Author: Manuele Sarfatti
Learning Objectives
We've talked about a PHP framework like Laravel, let's look into a Javascript one! At the end of this 5-day challenge you will:

be able to create a new React application
be able to "think in React"
be able to use basic hooks for managing state and reactivity
be able to organize your app in components
Your mission
This time the task is simple: you will build a small Todo application that lives in your browser, and saves todos even after browsers restart.

Useful resources
React introduces a few uncommon concepts that can be difficult to understand at first. Here is a list of useful resources you can refer to - before, during, and after this exercise.

Official Documentation
It's well written and made available in many languages.

Main concepts, starting with the famous "Hello world" example: https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html
"Thinking in React": https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html
If you prefer to learn by doing, you can follow the introductory tutorial: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html
YouTube
There is a TON of React material on YouTube. Choose your own flavor, but make sure that you watch videos that were released in the last year or so.

One suggestion, very relevant to this exercise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY

Side note: a couple of years ago React went from using mainly "class" based components to mainly "functional" components. Any tutorial that focuses on functional components, and special functions called "hooks" is up to date. Don't waste time on class components, they are the old way.

Online Course
Again, there are a TON of courses out there. The same rule applies: make sure they are recent, and they use functional components and hooks.

A good, free, course: https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react

Blogs
Sometimes you will find a good explanation for a specific feature or problem in blogs. These are two blogs that always deliver high-quality content:

Deliverables
Publish the source code on your GitHub repository
Deploy the project on Netlify
Tip: to deploy a React app you first run the command npm run build, and once the command finishes you will have your app ready in the build folder: just drag and drop this folder in Netlify and you are done. Easy!
Good luck!
